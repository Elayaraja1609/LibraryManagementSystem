## Getting Started üßë‚Äçüíª
Follow these steps to set up the project locally.
### Prerequisites
* .NET SDK 8.0+ installed
* SQL Server (LocalDB or a SQL Server instance)
* Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code with C# extensions


## Run Locally üè†  
1) ### Clone the project  

~~~bash  
  git clone https://github.com/Elayaraja1609/LibraryManagementSystem.git
~~~

2) ### Configure the Database Connection:
* Update the appsettings.json file with your SQL Server connection string:
~~~bash
"ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=LibraryDB;Trusted_Connection=True;"
}
~~~
3) ### Run Migrations:
 Generate and apply migrations to set up the database schema and seed data:
~~~bash
dotnet ef migrations add InitialCreate
dotnet ef database update
~~~
4) ### Run the Project:
~~~bash
dotnet run
~~~
5) ### Access Swagger for API Documentation:
* Navigate to `http://localhost:5273/swagger` to view and test the API endpoints.

## Default Seeded Data
The application starts with some default categories, such as Fiction, Non-Fiction, Science, History, Biography, and more. This data is automatically seeded in the Category table upon migration.

## Usage
* Once the application is running, open your browser and go to:

    * GET /v1/admin/books: Retrieve a list of all books.
    * POST /v1/admin/books: Add a new book.
    * PUT /v1/admin/books/{id}: Update an existing book.
    * DELETE /v1/admin/books/{id}: Delete a book by ID.
* This will display the full Swagger UI with detailed API documentation, including all available endpoints, request and response structures, and sample data.
